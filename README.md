# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

## Project description
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer randomly selects a word from a given list and the user 
tries to guess it. 
In this program, the name of a fruit is randomly selected from a given list of fruits and the user inputs letters to 
try and guess the word.
The user is asked to input letters as guesses one at a time, the computer will then tell the user if the letter is in 
the word or not and will ask the user to try again if the input is invalid. After each guess the program will print a visualisation of the word being guessed with any correctly guessed letters filled in. The user will be also be updated on how many lives they have left after guessing an incorrect letter!
In this program, each instance of the game is defined with a class and the operations are performed through the methods 
and attributes of the defined Hangman class 
The game is then defined as a function containing a while loop that evaluates the number of lives reamining and the  number of correct letter 
guesses to print the outcome of the game, either you guess all the letters of the word and win, or you run out of lives and lose!
